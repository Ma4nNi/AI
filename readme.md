# Overview

These are the class **projects** done over **one semester** of the **Artificial Intelligence **  class imparted in **CETYS University** by  the teacher Luz Maria Lozano.

Most of the algorithms and excercises done here are **based on** the book: **"Artificial Intelligence a Modern Approach"** by Stuart Russel and Peter Norvig.


# Contents

- **Chapter 2 - *The nature of environments*** 
	>SampleAgentEnvironment is a flappy bird demo of a simple agent(flappy) interacting with an [environment](https://github.com/ntasfi/PyGame-Learning-Environment).
- **Chapter 3 - *Solving problems by searching*** 
	 >Informed-search: Implementations of AStar and greedy search algorithms based on the book mentioned
  
# How To:
To run any project you should just go to the appropiate folder until you find a file named: main.py and run   

    python main.py

## Special Cases

You need to install the PyGame-Learning Environment as a pip module to make the chapter 2 excercises work.
